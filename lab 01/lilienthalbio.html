    I am a student in the iSchool studying Information Management and Technology with a concentration of web design. Iâ€™m interested in working on the back end code of sites but also the visual display to let my creative side shine through. My skills that help me in this field include being a problem solver, attention to detail and being naturally creative/artistic. Outside of Hinds Hall, I enjoy cooking for my roommates, talking walks in nature, painting, FaceTiming my parents and of course saying hi to my dog on FaceTime! I have always been interested in technology and code and I am excited to combine my passion of art with skill of coding.
