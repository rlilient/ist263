                I am a student in the <strong>iSchool</strong> studying <strong>Information Management and Technology</strong> with a concentration of <strong>web design</strong>. Iâ€™m interested in working on the back end code of sites but also the visual display to let my creative side shine through. My skills that help me in this field include being a problem solver, attention to detail and being naturally creative/artistic.
